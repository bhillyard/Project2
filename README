Contents of this directory

demos:
	This includes a few small programs that use the LWP library.
	Bear in mind that these are, in fact, fairly gentle on the
	library, but they give something to link against.

lib64:
	This includes archive versions of my LWP library and
	of the snakes library. You can use them or sub in your
	own.

	Remember, to run the demos, you'll have to include this
	directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

include:
	This has the headers you'll need:
	
	fp.h:     everything you need to save the floating point state
	lwp.h:    header for the LWP library
	snakes.h: header for the snakes library
